# Stock-Analysis-Prophet
Stock market time-series analysis using Python and Prophet. Applies moving average filtering, ACF/CCF analysis, and one-step forecasting on NIFTY50 and major stocks to study trends, correlations, and short-term predictions with clear visual insights.
A key highlight of this project is the implementation of Meta’s Prophet forecasting model, which performs one-step-ahead predictions for both stock prices and returns. This enables short-term trend estimation and helps evaluate the stability of different stocks relative to NIFTY50.
